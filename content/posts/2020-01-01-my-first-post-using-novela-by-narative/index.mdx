***An Encounter With Programming!***


You know what they say, what you are seeking, is seeking you. 
I have changed 4 professions till date, in search of something satisfying and magical, that would challenge me and raise the bar higher everytime. However that quest always landed me in jobs, which were vanity and media oriented. That's what I like to call vacation jobs, you enjoy them for a while but then they start getting on your nerves with extreme socilalizing and people pleasing. Unfortunately which was 80 percent the case than not, the reason why you would climb the ladder. Deep down inside I was looking for a massive shift in life. Which would help me build myself and ofcourse the career.

**Then The Magic Hapenned...**

I got introduced to programming through a very dear friend. That's when my love affair with programming started. Honestly this relationship has it's ups and downs, love hate phases, however at the end of it all, I love what we share. 

So I will be using this space to share my experience of taking the step to change my career at the age of 31. Taking the leap of faith by joining a 6 month **Full stack programming fellowship at Altcampus in the **Himalyas**.
