***An Encounter With Programming!***


You know what they say, what you are seeking, is seeking you. 
I have changed 4 professions till date, in search of something satisfying and magical, that would challenge me and raise the bar higher everytime. However that quest always landed me in jobs, which were vanity and media oriented. That's what I like to call vacation jobs, you enjoy them for a while but then they start getting on your nerves with extreme socilalizing and people pleasing. Unfortunately which was 80 percent the case than not, the reason you would climb the ladder. Deep down inside I was looking for a massive shift in life. Which would help me build myself and ofcourse the career.

**Then The Magic Hapenned...**
